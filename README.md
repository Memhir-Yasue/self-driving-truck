Make AI based self-driving truck in 'American Truck Simulator'
The goal of this project is to get hands-on learning experience with neural networks and computer vision in the sector of autonomous driving.
I'm not expecting a perfect system, but I do think that it will be both interesting and entertaining to watch a computer learn to drive.
The simulation enviornment I'll be using is 'American Truck Simulator', mainly because I am limited to the mac OS.

From here, I plan on taking the challenge to the skies: to train an ML model to fly a plane/helicopter in a simulated enviornment. So far I haven't heard of anyone attempting this,
so why not be the first? I'm just curious to see how far the limits can be pushed :)
