Main goal: To create an AI based self-driving truck in 'American Truck Simulator'
The main idea behind this project is to get hands-on learning experience with neural networks and computer vision in the field of autonomous driving.
I'm not expecting a perfect system, but I do think that it will be both interesting and entertaining to watch a computer learn to drive.
The simulation enviornment I'll be using is 'American Truck Simulator', mainly because I am limited to the mac OS.

From here, I plan on taking the challenge to the skies: to train an ML model to fly a plane/helicopter in a simulated enviornment. So far I haven't heard of anyone attempting this, so why not be the first? I'm just curious to see how far the limits can be pushed :) 


UPDATE Feb 2021: The main issue behind the project is the data collection aspect. Either my Mac is running slow or I need to do some optimizations (I'm currently getting 5-10 FPS). I'm wondering if I should instead use C++ for the screen capture and data processing aspect. To be seen! 

UPDATE March 2021: I've decided to port the data collection aspect to a new project: gaior (Game Agnostic Input Output Register)
